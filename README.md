# Auditing-and-hardening-scripts
A couple of project scripts to assist in auditing and hardening systems quickly
These started development during Cybersecurity Bootcamp and are merely in an infancy stage. They or only scratching the surface of what they could accomplish and I will be updating them at some point. 
Developed and tested on a Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS system
I take no responsibility for what this code does to your individual systems
